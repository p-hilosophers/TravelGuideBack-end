# TravelGuideBack-end

TravelGuideBack-end is a part of a project that we are trying to make a Travel Guide which recommends routes based on the most popular places
from Flickr. We retrieve the pictures from some cities and the places where the most photos are taken and we mentioned those as sights. The procedure
which retrieves the photos and fills the database is at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/p-hilosophers/TravelGuide-DatabaseHandler). For the user interface
we use an Android application which is [here](https://github.com/p-hilosophers/TravelGuide)

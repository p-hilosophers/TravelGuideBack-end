# TravelGuideBack-end

TravelGuideBack-end is a part of a project that we are trying to make a Travel Guide which recomment routes based on the most popular places
from Flickr. We retrieve the photos from some cities and the  places which taken the most photos we mentioned these as a sight. The procedure
which retrieves the photos and fill the database is at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/p-hilosophers/TravelGuide-DatabaseHandler). For the user interface
we use an Android application which is [here](https://github.com/p-hilosophers/TravelGuide.)
